```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## The question you are answering

You use the `##` to create a header. Use the header to indicate the question you are answering. After the header, in this space here, annotate your answer, telling us what you did.

```{r chunk name}
# Here is where your R code goes. ``` opens the code chunk, followed by {r}. Then ``` closes the chunk. When you 'knit' the file, the codes will evaluate.

dat <- read.csv("path/to/data/data.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r another chunk name}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
